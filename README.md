============================================================================
This is the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course

There are several parts to this project:
1. The training and test sets were merged into one data set (link to original data and author reference below)
2. The R script called run_analysis.R was created to perform all data manipulation associated with this project.
3. Only features that contained mean and standard deviation measurements were kept in the final tidy dataset.  	
4. Descriptive activity names are used to identify the activity levels such as walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying in the final tidy data set.
5. A second tidy data set containing the subject averages for each activity level was created
6. Refer to Codebook in repo for detailed instructions on how the data was manipulated.
7. Additionally the run_analysis.R script has many explanatory comments within the code.
