Codebook

1. Used R version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21) -- "Bug in Your Hair"
2. RScript called run_analysis.R created on 4Dec2016
3. Downloaded UCI HAR Dataset file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/
   getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
4. The downloaded information contained the following information: activity_labels.txt, 
	features_info.txt, features.txt, README.txt, test subfolder and train subfolder
5. Within the test subfolder, R code was written to merge subject_test.txt, X-test.txt, 
	and y_text.txt files.
6. Within the train subfolder, R code was written to merge subject_train.txt, X-train.txt, 
	and y_train.txt files.
7. RBind() was then used to join the combined_train and combined_test data sets creating
the final tidy data set containing the subject number, activity label, and measurement
variables containing only mean and standard deviation in their titles.
8. The dplyr package was then used to calculate the mean of the values at each activity level (walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs,
sitting, standing and laying) thereby creating the second tidy dataset for the project.
